Methodology</h3><dd>

The college is making an attempt in this direction in right earnest and with a promise that 

it would fulfill all that it promises. The following are the important/key ingredients of 

the teaching-learning process. This teaching-learning process is a combination of the 

conventional mechanisms of learning such as lectures and laboratory sessions apart from the 

interactive teaching learning aids such as seminars, on-course projects, guest 

lectures/expert sessions, industrial visits, assignments, and preparing company profiles.
The college is giving each and every student a student diary which consists of day-to-day 

planning and accounts of all these activities.</dd><dd>

In case of interactive teaching learning process, use of an innovative concept called as 

‘Learning Groups (LGs)’ is used.</dd><dt>
lectures</dt><dd>
Lectures are designed to provide you with the framework of a subject. They normally last for 

one hour and are given by specialist staff. You are encouraged to note main points and 

handouts are often given summarizing the important points and explaining any complicated 

issues or diagrams.</dd>

<dt>seminars</dt><dd>
Seminars characteristically, involve ‘Learning Groups (LGs)’ and a member of teaching staff. 

They provide an opportunity for active discussion on relevant topics, many of which will 

have been covered in the lectures, help develop transferable skills such as communication 

and teamwork and offer a platform for you to participate fully in your learning. For 

example, before a seminar, you may have to complete recommended reading to ensure you come 

prepared to participate in the discussion. The major feature of a seminar is that you are 

encouraged to take a measure of control over your studies and to contribute positively to 

these discussions. Many first year students initially feel tense and nervous when taking 

part in seminars, but as their knowledge and confidence level grow, they soon start enjoy 

this stimulating way of learning process.
<dd><dt>ON-Course Projects</dt><dd>
One of the important aids towards understanding either a concept or a skill pertaining to 

each of the field of knowledge is getting exposed to practical side of the discipline. 

Towards this end, each ‘Learning Group (LG)’ will have to do a minimum of one project in a 

year containing a minimum of 80 man-hours to 100 man-hours and a full time end course 

project consisting of 800 to 1000 man-hours. The on course projects could be in-house 

(within the college) or in the field,
i.e. in industry or research organizations. It is compulsory that the end course project 

shall be in the field under the guidance of an internal faculty and the expert in the field 

(from the industry where the project is taken-up).</dd><dt>Guest Lectures</dt><dd>
So as to provide the students with expert advice and guidance, the college organizes regular 

guest lectures and expert training sessions.
The student learning groups shall coordinate with the faculty in arranging guest lectures. 

The student will be responsible for accompanying the guest lectures, providing the 

hospitality and honouring them. The student groups in rotation will prepare synopsis of the 

lecture and present to the classmates. They will also be responsible in sending the 

necessary feedback to the concerned guest lecturers immediately.</dd><dt>Student Assignments</dt><dd>
Each ‘Learning Group (LG)’ shall take-up a minimum of one assignment in a semester and the 

faculty will specially design these assignments. The assignment is given essentially having 

an application orientation or will be with a problem solving nature.
