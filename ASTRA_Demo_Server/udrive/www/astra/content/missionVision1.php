<dl><dd>
  Aurora envisions &quot;to make itself synonymous with learning&quot;. We, at Aurora, believe that colleges, the temples of learning shall not stagnate as exaggerated tutorials offering shortsighted courses. We envisage a role for ourselves as a centre of higher learning where we cherish, nurture and disseminate knowledge and thereby establish ourselves as pioneers in &quot;holistic education&quot;.
</dl></dd>
<dl><dd>
  To serve nation as a centre for advancement, preservation and dissemination of knowledge. We aim to equip our students with a perfect synthesis of human values, ancient wisdom and modern thought. Thus, ensuring that when they foray into the fiercely competitive and advanced technological world, they do not turn into mere but retain their sense of self as direct result of what they &quot;learnt&quot; with us.
