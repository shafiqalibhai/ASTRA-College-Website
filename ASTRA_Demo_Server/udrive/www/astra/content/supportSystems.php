  <dd>
    One of the essential observations made in the past years is that, some students have a non-serious attitude towards placements.  This stems from their immature mind set.  Orientation arranged for such students did have an impact but that was not as much as expected.  In this context the placement cell has come out with placement charter, which necessarily sets guidelines for the system to be effective and maximize results.  An extract of charter reads as below.  </dd>
  <dt>ACADAMIC REQUIREMENT</dt>
  It is mandatory for a student to have a consistent academic tract record which would be measured in terms of their percentage of marks, which has to be 65% and above.  Also, he / she should not have any backlogs.
  
  <dt>ATTENDANCE</dt>
  A student having more than 75% attendance in each and every subject can get the benefit of registering for placements.
  
  <dt>LIMITED OPPORTUNITY</dt>
  For each student, a maximum of 3 placements opportunities will be given.  This is primarily aimed at providing a fair chance to every student.
  
  <dt>PENALIZATION FOR NON-ACCEPTANCE</dt>
  A student once selected in a particular company has to necessarily take up the appointment failing which, his / her name may be stuck off from availing a chance in the further placement process.
  
  <dt>COMMITMENT</dt>
  Recruiting companies generally have a stipulation that an employee should stick to the job, at least for a period of two years.  The placement cell expects this commitment to be present in all the selected students.
  
  <dt>ALL ABOUT YOU</dt>
  To facilitate the employer to have an insight into all the aspects of his prospective employee, the placement cell intends to give the copies of ‘All About You’ collected from the student directly to the prospective employers.
  
  <dt>PHYSICAL EDUCATION</dt>
  Physical education is the integral part of the technical education.  It is an old subject and in the modern education, it has been accepted as a subject to suit the conditions existing today.  Physical education helps in developing the physical fitness, social efficiency of an individual.  The objectives of physical education are organic development, neuro-muscular coordination, interpretative development and emotional development.  The concept of total education will be complete only when there is a proper and balanced blend of mental and physical quality activities.

  <dt>NSS UNIT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</dt>
  The aim of NSS is mainly centered on the personality development of the students through community service and programs National Service Scheme are a centrally sponsored scheme.  It is alunched on 24th September 1969; as a student Youth Service Program with 40,000 volunteers in 37 Universities.  At present 19,30,000 NSS Volunteers were enrolled in 174 universities in the country.
  
  The NSS Activities in AP alloted strength in 1,30,000 where as 1,45,717 volunteers were entrolled from Junior, Degree, Professional and university Colleges under 12 Universities during 2001 and 2002.  The NSS activities under OU are the allocation strength is 27000, but the volunteers enrolled 29,540 from 225 colleges under 6 districts during 2001-02.
  
  <dt>THE CONCEPT OF NSS</dt>
  The overall concept of NSS as envisaged earlier, is to given an extension dimension to the higher education system and orients the student youth to community service while they are studying in educational  institution.  The reason for the formulation of this objective is the general realization that the colleges and the +2 level students have a tendency to get alienated from the villages/slum masses which constitute tha majority of the population of the country.  The educated youth who are expected to take the reins of administration in future are found to be unaware of the problems of the village/slum community and in certain cases are indifferent towards their needs and problems.  Therefore it is necessary to arouse the social conscience of the students, and to provide them an opportunity to work with the people in the villages and slums.
  
  <dt>THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE NSS</dt>
  The NSS strives the youth to develop a positive attitude towards the community and commitment to work for the upliftment of the weaker sections and downtrodden people in the society.  The NSS also creates a module to involve the student youth for the process of social development in the country by inculcating the qualities such as social consciousness, service to the community sense of responsibility.  Personality Development and self-confidence.  This helps to contribute towards national integration, attaining perfection, creditability, stability and maturity.  The NSS proves to groom the student youth into an active citizen, which brings about satisfaction to an individual and promotes peace in the community.
  
  Community service rendered by NSS volunteers has covered several aspects like adoption of villages for intensive development work, carrying out medico-social service setting up of medical centers, programs of mass  immunization, sanitation drives, adult education programs for the weaker sections of the community, blood donation helping patients in hospitals, helping inmates of orphanages and physically handicapped etc.  The NSS volunteers did commendable relief work during natural calamities emergencies such as cyclones, floods, feminine, earthquake etc from time to time all over the country.  They have also done useful work in organizing campaigns for eradication of social evils and popularization of nation accepted objectives like nationalism, democracy, secularism, social harmony and evelopment of scientific temper.
  
  <dt>THE MOTTO OF THE NSS</dt>
  The motto of NSS “not me but you” is a sense of expression on face it appears to be very simple and short, but behind it lies a lot of meaning.  It is very deep and suggestive and is quiet in keeping with the spirit of NSS.  The expression stands for two things.
  
  1.	Forgetting and surrendering the self and 
  2.	Rendering selfless service for others.
  
  The word “not” before “me” is to reduce the self to enhance the importance of others.  The abriddged expression “not me but you” can be simply expanded as follows: I don’t live for me, but for you.  The world is not only for me but for you also.  The motto of NSS reminds us of the words of swami Vivekananda “not I but thou” Which advises to forget ourselves completely whatever we may be according to the swami the watchword of all moral good, is “not I but thou”.  Here it is the world and it is full of misery.  We should try to lessen the misery and to make it worth living for all.
