  <dl><h3>CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE</h3><dd>
The centers for excellence developed in various departments based on the expertise available, are aid in motivating the student community in co-curricular and extra – curricular activities.</dd>
<dd>
Each department identified centers of excellence in a specific area, based on the research work being done by the faculty, the Industry Institute Interaction in that specific area and the infrastructure facilities being developed by the department. This enables the students to conduct their projects in an effective way.  These centers not only guide the students in their project works but also motivating them to go for higher studies in specific areas.</dd>

<dt>CENTRE FOR CAREER COUNSELLING</dt><dd>
This centre, run by committed faculty coordinators, aims to increase students’ awareness about courses, alternatives and job opportunities available after graduation in various fields and disciplines. The centre collates relevant information from over 500 brochures of universities/institutes across the world, and presents them as easy-to-understand posters displayed in the college premises. The college also invites professional counselors and experts to interact with students and advice them on the myriad career challenges that they are likely to encounter.</dd>


<dt>CENTRE FOR COMMUNICATION AND PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT</dt><dd>

This centre enhances the language and communication skills of the students. The importance of good communication skills cannot be overemphasized in a globalized world. Aurora imparts special training  to students to be efficient communicators by conducting group discussions, simulations and mock-interview sessions, debates, extempore, etc. Every Auroran is, therefore, better equipped to carve a niche for him/herself in the challenging global scenario.</dd>

<dt>CENTRE FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</dt><dd>

In an attempt to promote teamwork and develop a sense of responsibility towards society, the students of Aurora are encouraged to engage with contemporary and relevant social issues. From illiteracy to poverty, to pollution, the team endeavors to make a difference in the world we are living in. The Youth Red Cross Society of the college regularly organizes blood donation camps. Students are strongly advised to donate blood at these camps and make their contribution to the larger community.</dd>
