<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3><br /><dt>a. In India</dt>
Worked for about fourteen years with the Structural  Engineering Research Centre, Roorkee,   India, a  premier organisation of research in structural engineering. The  responsibilities as a scientist involved mainly participation in various  research and design projects, and providing consultancy services and training  facilities to other organisations and engineering students. Other  responsibilities included working on the committees of the Indian Standards  Institution, and the Indian Roads Congress for drafting various codes of  practice.<br />
The  projects participated included various aspects of bridge structures,  prestressed concrete structures, composite structures, non-destructive testing,  testing of beam models, studies on bridge loadings, live load studies on  bridges, and preparation of design aids and computer software.<br />
During  the stay of about fourteen years with the Structural Engineering Research  Centre, published more than 40 research papers, 14 research reports and one  handbook on design tables for concrete bridge deck slabs, attended several  conferences and seminars, and contributed discussions on several publications.<br />
Worked  with the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, and later with V. R. Siddhartha Engineering College,  Vijayawada, and Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad after returning to India in 1988.<br />
Presently  working with the University College of Engineering (Autonomous), Hyderabad. In addition,  conducted post-graduate classes for the Jawaharlal  Nehru Technological  University, Hyderabad,  and for the Regional Engineering College,  Warangal (off-campus centre at Hyderabad).<br />
The  responsibilities include teaching structural analysis and design, CAD, Theory  of Elasticity, Plasticity, Plates and Shells, and the FEM to under-graduate and  post-graduate students, supervising the research projects at under-graduate,  post-graduate and doctoral levels, providing consultancy services,  participating on various committees, and carrying out research on various  aspects of civil engineering. Recorded  more than 30 lectures on strength of materials and theory of structures.<br />
Other  activities include developing course materials and courses, and interaction  with other organisations such as Engineering Staff College of India, National  Council of Cement and Building Materials and National Academy of Construction in  training professional engineers. <br />
Supervised  several post-graduate and under-graduate projects. Conducting several site  visits, and developed computer programs for the use and training of students.  Prepared lecture notes for various courses on structural analysis and design.<br />
Published  a handbook on bridge deck slabs, a professional book on detailing of  reinforcement, a monograph on durability of concrete structures, and four  textbooks on structural analysis and strength of materials for under- and post-graduate  students.<br />
Several  under- and post-graduate students, who were supervised, published technical  papers in professional journals and conferences in India and overseas. Presently  supervising seven doctoral candidates.<br />
An active  consulting engineer, and a member, and chairman of enquiry and advisory  committees of Municipal Corporation, Hyderabad, High Court, Andhra Pradesh, and  Institution of Engineers (India), AP State Centre, and member, State Dam Safety  Inspection Committee.
 ;
<dt>b. In Germany</dt>
Worked with the Institut fuer Massivbau, University of Stuttgart  as a fellow of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) on deputation. The  research program was preceded by an intensive German language course at a  Geothe Institut in Germany,  which imparted good proficiency in the language at an advanced (Mittelstufe)  level.<br />
The  studies at the University   of Stuttgart included  advanced techniques, such as the methods of incremental launching and free  cantilever construction, analysis and design of concrete structures with  particular reference to box girder bridges, and advanced analysis using several  software packages, besides developing computer programs for analysis and design  of concrete structures.<br />
Visited  several construction sites and manufacturing units to learn about the  techniques adopted in Europe. Prepared  research reports in German on the analysis of box girders subjected to  distortional loading, box girders without support diaphragms, analysis of  concrete members under combined bending, shear and torsion.<br />
A few  papers based on these investigations were brought out in various journals, such  as Beton- und Stahlbetonbau (in German), the Journal of the American Concrete  Institute, Concrete International (ACI), and the Indian Concrete Journal. The  stay in Germany  also provided an opportunity to attend several international seminars and  conferences, and to interact with leading engineers and experts of industry.<br />
Visited Germany under the re-invitation programme of the  DAAD to work with the Institute fuer Leichtbau Entwerfen und Konstruieren  (Institute for Lightweight Structural Conceptual Design and Construction), Stuttgart University (1. November  30 December  2002) for two months. The visit was  intended to study the current developments in structural design and  construction.
<dt>c. In Australia</dt>
Worked for doctorate degree with the Department of Civil  and Agricultural Engineering, University   of Melbourne. The  research project dealt with thermal stresses in concrete bridges due to  insolation effects. These stresses, not usually considered in the design of  bridges, have led to distress in several structures.<br />
The  investigations have led to the development of design temperature distributions  for concrete bridges of various configurations for the ambient data in Melbourne, Australia  and in New Delhi, India. Comprehensive studies on the  influence of various parameters on thermal stresses were carried out, and the  stresses under the temperature distributions recommended by various codes of  practice were compared. Variation of thermal stresses in bridges curved in  plan, and in non-prismatic structures was also reported. The effects of creep  on thermal stresses were investigated, and a critical review of literature on  various aspects of thermal stresses was presented. A comprehensive document on  the major computer programs developed on these aspects was also prepared.<br />
<br />
<b>Thesis title : </b>Design temperature distributions and thermal  stresses in concrete bridges<br />
<br />
These investigations were broad  based, and were published in the proceedings of international conferences and  journals of various countries, such as Australia,  India, Libya, Singapore  and the U. S. A.<br />
Apart  from the research program, the stay with the University of Melbourne  provided an opportunity to gain teaching experience as well. The subjects  handled included Mechanics of Solids, Concrete Structures, Computer  Programming, Steel Structures, and Introduction to Engineering. These courses  were taught at the Departments of Civil and Agricultural Engineering, and  Architecture and Building Science of the University of Melbourne,  and at the Department of Civil and Aeronautical Engineering of the Royal  Melbourne Institute of Technology. <br />
The stay provided rich experience  through interaction with various professionals and experts, and through helping  other graduate students.<br />
Attended  several seminars and conferences, and presented papers on the research  investigations completed from time to time. Visited several construction sites  and manufacturing units to gain insight into the new developments in  construction industry, besides conducting site visits for the students of the  University.<br />
