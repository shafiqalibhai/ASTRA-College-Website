    <h3>DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h3>
    <br>
    <dd>The fast changing technological scenario poses to the Institute a challenge 
      of continuously updating its knowledge and faculty to be able to provide 
      state-of-the-art education to the students. The different departments of 
      the Institute have made changes, both major and subtle, to be better prepared 
      for tomorrow. Aurora's Scientific, Technological and Research Academy has it&rsquo;s reputation for high 
      quality teaching and research makes Both an excellent destination for those 
      seeking to enhance their future prospects by studying for higher degrees. 
      The Department of Information Technology offers Master&rsquo;s programmes in 
      highly topical areas of computer science.</dd>
    <dd>The Information Technology Department 
      at Aurora's Scientific, Technological and Research Academy formally established in 2000 but it 
      has existed as a `undergraduate programme&#39; leading to B.Tech since then. 
      Today we also offer M.Tech programme in CSE. In the undergraduate programme, 
      the first batch graduated in 2004.</dd>
    <dt>Faculty </dt>
    <dd>The Department currently has twenty one faculty members. Our Faculty 
      interest spans a wide range: from abstract theory to down-to-earth problems 
      of immediate interest to industry. Teaching load is fairly low, typically 
      a faculty member teaches two courses, and possibly one tutorial in a year. 
      Further, one of these two courses can be an elective as per the choice of 
      the faculty member.</dd>
    <dt>Academic Programmes </dt>
    <dd>The Department of Information Technology 
      offer B.Tech. (60 students per year), M.Tech. (18 students per year). Students 
      have a lot of flexibility in choosing courses. With a view to impart quality 
      education we offer continuing education programme to our staff by enrolling 
      them in our PG programmes.</dd>
    <dt>Computing Facilities </dt>
    <dd>The Department has a modern laboratory to serve the teaching and research 
      needs of the students and faculty of the Department. The labs currently 
      have Four 2.4 GHz P-IV Servers, and one Intel Xeon 3 GHz Servers and about 
      84 Pentium IV PCs, 19 Pentium III PCs, and 34 Celeron PCs. All systems are 
      connected to the Departmental LAN which is a part of the Institute-wide 
      area network. The file servers provide a combination of Unix (NFS) and NT 
      (NTFS) file services. Internet connectivity is provided by a 2 Mbps link 
      leased from BSNL exclusively for the Department. </dd>
    <dt>Relation with Industry </dt>
    <dd>The Department has close interaction with a number of industry and Government 
      agencies. The main modes of interaction are projects and short-term courses.</dd>
