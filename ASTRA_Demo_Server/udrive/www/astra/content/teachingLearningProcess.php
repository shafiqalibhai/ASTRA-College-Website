    <h3>TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS</h3>
    <dd>The college is making  an attempt in right earnest and with the determination, to deliver on its  promises. The salient feature of the teaching-learning process is that it  synthesizes conventional mechanisms of learning, such as lectures, laboratory  sessions and projects, with interactive teaching-learning aids like: like  seminars, guest lectures/expert sessions, industrial visits, and assignments.  For the teaching-learning process to be truly interactive, the innovative  concept of ‘learning groups’ has been adopted. </dd>
    <dd>In addition, each  student receives this student Handbook, which provides a detailed plan of  activities to be undertaken during the semester/year.</dd>
    <dt>CONVENTIONAL LEARNING METHODOLOGY</dt>
    <dt>LECTURES</dt>
    <dd> Lectures are designed  to provide the framework of a subject. They normally last for one hour and are  given by expert faculty. Students are expected to note the main points.  Handouts are often given summarizing the important points and explaining  complex concepts. </dd>
    <dt>LABORATORIES</dt>
    <dd>Laboratory work is  essential to science and engineering. It provides students with an opportunity  to apply their knowledge and develop appropriate practical skills. Laboratories  normally involve carrying out experiments using some of the most sophisticated  equipment. Both group and individual project work is undertaken in the  scheduled laboratory sessions.</dd>
    <dd>In addition to the  experiments prescribed in the syllabi, students will be carrying out the  application oriented and advanced exepriments in the laboratories. </dd>
    <dt>Projects</dt>
    <dd> The knowledge acquired  by the students during the course of his/her tenure culminates during the  project of the student. The project work is the essential ingredient of the  U.G. programme of engineering which depicts not only the knowledge of student  in various theoretical courses, but also shows the experimental skills  developed by the candidate.  Needless to  say that the project report developed by a student would be referred to by a  group of experts in assessing the skills of the candidate atleast in the  initial phases of candidate’s career development. The serious involvement of  staff members in the student’s project work will go a long way in increasing  the rapport with the students and the department gets benefit by the way of infrastructure  and development. As such Aurora’s Scientific Technological &amp; Research Academy  gives a lot of importance to student’s project work.</dd>
    <dt>INTERACTIVE LEARNING METHODOLOGY</dt>
    <dd>Interactive Learning  Methodology aims at giving the students experience in practical implementation  of the theoretical concepts. By accentuating interest among students towards  technological developments, the programme keeps them informed and updated with  the rapidly changing developments in various spheres of the industry.</dd>
    <dd>Guest lectures by  those who made a difference inculcate right insights and inspire students to  identify the thrust areas and fields potential for individual and collective  excellence. Students Seminars enhance the confidence of the participants and  give them proper orientation in making technical presentations and in striking  a difference in Group Discussions. Further, Assignments, Industry-Institute  interaction, Industrial tours, Adjunct Courses strengthen the practical and  creative experience.</dd>
    <dd>An innovative concept  of Learning Groups has been introduced to make learning truly interactive and  creative. </dd>
    <dt>LEARNING GROUPS</dt>
    <dd>The  students in each class are facilitated to form &quot;Learning Groups&quot; of  three each.  Each Learning Group is named  after a scientist (Related to Engineering &amp; Technology). The concept behind  the Learning Groups is to enhance the interaction and teamwork among the  students in a class.  Also, it aids in  building confidence among the students.</dd>
    <dd>Separate  Learning Groups are formed for the various activities in order to create a  healthy interest among the students to participate and for the successful  implementation of the interactive Learning Methodology. Also the members of one  Learning Group are not duplicated in the other. Each Learning Group is guided  by a faculty organizer and is ranked by him based on their performance, after  their participation in the concerned activity.</dd>
    <dd>It  is mandatory for the students to know the significant contribution of the  scientist, after whom the group is named and also submit a report on the  scientist profile to the concerned organizer.</dd>
    <dt>GUEST  LECTURES</dt>
    <dt>PRELUDE</dt>
    <dd> In addition to the  curriculum designed by the university, the subjects need to be exposed to the  latest development in the field which could not be included as topics in the  curriculum by the university because of certain contraints. Keeping in view,  the college, insides the experts from industry and higher learning centre for  giving Guest Lecture on topics of current interest.</dd>
    <dt>OBJECTIVE</dt>
    <dd>To have a through  understanding of certain concepts, new application area, new developments which  a student may not get exposed otherwise, the guest lectures will go a long way  in stimulating the students and make them interested in the subject.
      </dt>
    <dt>STUDENT ASSIGNMENTS</dt>
    <dd>The assignment  submission is mandatory for all the learning groups.  The handbook provides the collection of  various exams question bank for each unit (minimum of 40 questions) from JNTU,  GATE, IES &amp; other universities.  This  is in order to prepare the students in most of the topics and make them  confident for the final examinations of each semester.    Each learning group has to submit in all 5  assignments from each subject.  </dd>
    <dt>STUDENT SEMINARS</dt>
    <dt>PRELUDE</dt>
    <dd>All the faculty and  the students are well aware that &quot;Student Seminars&quot; is an important  item of the New Teaching Methodology, an Aurora's innovation introduced in the  College during the academic year 2004-05, continued to be implemented  successfully. After watching the working of the new Methodology introduced on  pilot basis during the last year, it is considered that it has come to stay for  the attendant benefits thereof and therefore it is felt necessary to evolve  detailed procedure for organizing Student Seminars forming part of the new  Teaching Methodology.</dd>
    <dt>OBJECTIVE</dt>
    <dd>To inculcate and  improve presentation and communications skills of the students which have  become mandatory in the present day world, for better career to the aspirants,  to enroll themselves in the Register of  &quot;Competitive  World&quot; in addition to “learning the subject through teaching”.</dd>
    <dt>INDUSTRY-INSTITUTION INTERACTION </dt>
    <dd>For any Engineering College to flourish a continuous and  healthy interaction with industries is essential for producing Engineers of  high quality.  As the College follows  curriculum designed by the University with its limitations of not able to cope  up with the fast changing scenario in technology, the continuous interaction of  industry will go a long way in upgrading the skills of the staff and students  and to keep them abreast with the latest technologies.  </dd>
    <dd>Inaddition to the  above Aurora’s Scientific Technological &amp; Research Academy is on the verge  of signing Memorandum of Understanding with industries through which both the  industry and the College identifies the common working areas for mutual  benefit.</dd>
    <dt>MINI PROJECTS </dt>
    <dt>Prelude</dt>
    <dd>The goal of the mini  projects is to get the student to explore research and development in detail in  a specific area.  The mini projects start  in summer, in any industry/research lab or other academic institutions, as  desided by the project advisor.  It may  in some cases culminate in student continuing his work in association with the  organisation for the the final project also, if the student desires and with  the concurrance of the department.</dd>
    <dt>INDUSTRIAL / EDUCATIONAL TOURS</dt>
    <dd>It is important for  students of technical education to keep themselves abreast of changes taking  place in the industry. Towards this end, the college organizes regular  industrial tours. Each student is expected to visit at least one company,  either Indian or a multinational, every semester. The student must prepare in  advance a detailed note on the industry to be visited. Information could be  collected from the website of the company or any other source. The student,  guided by the faculty, shall conduct a survey/interview of the people and the  place visited. He/she shall then prepare a detailed report of the tour for a  class presentation.</dd>
    <dt>ADJUNCT COURSES</dt>
    <dd>The adjunct instructor  integrates academic content from the lecture with study strategies, techniques  in order to improve problem-solving skills, develop stress management and study  strategies and promise academic success.</dd>
    <dd>Every year each  department conducts atleast one adjunct course, during intervening period of I  &amp; II semesters. Department identifies certain areas in which the students  of that branch are to be engaged, in order to compete with the competitive  environment which otherwise are not covered in their university curriculum.  A minimum of three adjunct courses are to be  circulated among the student community and based on the response, availability  of resource persons and the necessary inputs for conducting the course, the  department schedules to conduct the adjunct course(s).</dd>
    <dt>STUDENT COUNSELLING</dt>
    <dd>For the creation of  healthy academic atmosphere in the College, interaction with the students and  the staff is essential.  Staff members  are supposed to counsel the students not only in academic activities but also in  co-curricular and extra curricular activities and if necessary become guides in  their personal difficulties too.</dd>
    <dt>Alumni ASSOCIATION </dt>
    <dd> Aurora is proud to have its students in key positions at  several prestigious organizations in India and abroad. This gives  importance to the activities of the Alumni Association.  The Association helps its members and also  the students currently studying in the College in various activities.  </dd>
