	THE NEWSLETTER</dt><dd>
Learning as a community imparts great internal strength. Documented and non-documented knowledge of our nation (Vedas and Puranas) has taught us the necessity of creating opportunities for sharing the essence of all learning. ‘Akshara’, our newsletter, serves as a platform for students to share their feelings, ideas, values and hunches.</dd><dt>

	ALUMNI RELATIONS</dt><dd>
The Aurora alumni association is a group of highly successful individuals who are employed with many top-notch companies. And yet their success has served to further strengthen their roots in Aurora. They are today our ambassadors in the corporate world, benefiting both fellow alumni members and current students. This association provides an opportunity for alumni and friends to stay connected with their alma mater through programs and services that foster a lifetime relationship with the institution. In return, the college gains from their valued inputs on teaching methodologies, advancements, and research and industry trends. They also assist in counseling and identifying career opportunities.</dd><dd>

The Aurora alumni represent richness in diversity of age, geography, ethnicity and gender. The institute is truly cosmopolitan in having students from all the states in the country. And one of the many advantages every student of this college enjoys.
