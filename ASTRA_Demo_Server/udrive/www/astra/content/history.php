<h3>HISTORY</h3><dt>

<dt>THE BEGINNING</dt><dd>
It was in 1989 that Ramesh Nimmatoori, a young postgraduate in computer science engineering, decided to realize his dream. He made a humble but determined beginning with Aurora Degree College, set up under the aegis of the Aurora Educational Society. The college had four departments, namely Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics, and Electronics, with 62 students. They were housed in a rented  premises in the then suburban locality of Habsiguda. The college was later shifted to Gandhinagar,  but by December 1992, the college moved to its current location at Chikkadpally, a bustling area in the heart of the city.</dd>

<dt>THE LEAP</dt><dd>
In 1993, two new departments were added -- biological sciences and commerce. The student strength rose to 600 that year. From then on, there was no looking back. By 1998, the Degree College had more than 2000 students enrolled in various branches of study.  In 1995, the Aurora Educational Society established a Postgraduate College which offered two programmes, namely, Masters in Computer Applications and Masters in Business Administration. In 1998, Aurora touched new heights when it established its engineering college on a sprawling campus of 600 acres. It was a bold venture in the  area of higher education. Not long after, four more engineering colleges came up, followed closely by two   postgraduate colleges. Today, Aurora happens to be one of the largest educational groups in the state of Andhra Pradesh, with 7500 students on its rolls, more than 400 faculty and around 300 administrative staff.</dd>

<dt>THE NAME AND LOGO </dt><dd>
Aurora – the name for the college derives from aurora borealis, the celestial northern lights. It also has association with the Sun God Apollo and the Roman Goddess of Dawn, Aurora. The name synthesizes the Indian and Western traditions of representing the Sun as a symbol of knowledge and power. Education is a penance for knowledge and Aurora treats it thus. The logo has three critical components. The Italian colours – lilac and wild pink; the Egyptian pyramid signifying the letter A. Most importantly, the logo is emblematic of the spirit of the college – i.e. the temple of learning.</dd>

<dt>THE ICON AND HERITAGE</dt><dd>
Aurora is inspired by the great Indian Teacher Chanakya, who redefined the role of a teacher as being that of a torchbearer of society. He gave the clarion call “Tasmat Uttishta Bharata” – Oh Indian, Awake!  Seeking inspiration from this great Indian, Aurora imparts holistic education which is firmly rooted in India’s rich tradition, with our focus clearly on modern science and technology.</dd>

<dt>THE TRADITIONS</dt><dd>
Aurora is known for establishing unique traditions in every aspect of its functioning.  Be it pedagogical practices, advertising strategies, discipline, extramural activities and events, Aurora is in the forefront.  Today, it is no exaggeration that people across the country believe that Aurora is a trendsetter.</dd>

<dt>THE CULTURE</dt><dd>
Aurora nurtures a knowledge culture. It facilitates in tapping the latent potential of both the students and the staff. Aurora’s students and faculty command a distinct recognition among their peers and colleagues. It is this unique culture which has become the hallmark of Aurora.</dd>


<dt>THE VISION</dt><dd>
Aurora is committed to making itself “synonymous with learning”.  We, at Aurora, envisage a role for ourselves as a centre of higher learning where we cherish, nurture and disseminate knowledge and thereby establish ourselves as pioneers in “holistic education”.</dd>

<dt>THE MISSION</dt><dd>
Our mission is to serve the nation as a center for the advancement, preservation and dissemination of knowledge. We aim to endow our students with a perfect synthesis of human values, ancient wisdom and modern thought, thus ensuring that when they step into the fiercely competitive and technologically advanced world, they do not turn into mere automations but retain their sense of self as a direct result of what they “learnt” with us.</dd>
