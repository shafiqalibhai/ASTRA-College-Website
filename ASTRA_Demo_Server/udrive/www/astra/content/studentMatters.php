    <dt>INDUCTION PROGRAMME</dt>
    Every year the new  batch of students at Aurora’s Scientic  Technological and Research   Academy are warmly  received by the senior students and the staff.   The induction program is organized by the seniors of all departments  under the supervision of the faculty.   While the induction program is meant to make freshmen feel at ease in  their new environs, it has a serious purpose behind it. Students are primed  about the challenges that they will surely encounter over four years in such a  demanding course.  Apart from interacting  with the senior students, freshmen also get the opportunity to meet the  principal, heads of departments, faculty, and other functionaries of the  institution.

    <dt>VIOLATION OF ACADEMIC ISSUES</dt>
    <dt>BACKLOGS</dt>
    It has been observed  that students do not take the end semester/year exams seriously and  consequently perform poorly. This not only induces unnecessary pressure on the  students but also projects a negative image of the college. In order to  discourage students from accumulating backlogs, the college has decided to  impose the following academic punishment.
    </dd>
    <dt>“Students with  backlogs are supposed to answer FIVE previous JNTU question papers of the  subject concerned. Each paper will be answered THREE times, ONE MONTH prior to  the registration for the supplementary examinations.”</dt>
    <dt>FRESHERS’ DAY </dt>
    It is natural for the  senior students to give an enthusiastic welcome to their juniors. The Freshers’  Day celebrations are eagerly looked forward to. But it is observed that a lot  of time is wasted for lack of planning, and sometimes intentionally, due to  which regular academic work suffers. To avoid this, the college expects senior  students to complete organising the freshers’day within the stipulated time in  consultation with their respective head of the departments. It is necessary  that the Freshers’ Day should be held within four weeks from the commencement  of the academic year for the first year students.  Senior students are to form a committee and  work under the supervision of the head of the department. The members of the  committee will be held responsible for any misconduct that occurs on the  freshers’day. Serious disciplinary action will be taken against those who  deviate from the above-mentioned norms.
    </dd>
