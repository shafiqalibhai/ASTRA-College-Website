ASTRA-College-Website
=====================

I had mentioned earlier on twitter that I’d be uploading some recovered data from my broken hard drive. So here goes the first one.

Following is the link to a self extracting archive of the first project I ever did. My college website! Done with help of the great Subhash Dasyam.

This is a very very very old project. The structure of the website and code is horrible and outdated.

Make sure you scan this for virus. Most systems in our college were compromised. Also there should be a php shell in there somewhere … we used it for administrative purposes only.  :)

A thank you shout out to Mrs. Aruna Ranganath (CSE Head of Department) for getting me involved.

Ahhh… I feel nostalgic.  :)
